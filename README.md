# Mock AI Interviewer

- This project is a mock AI interviewer that asks you questions and records your answers ðŸ§ 

- The project is split into 3 parts, each with their own respective READMEs:
  - The backend which is responsible for the AI and the database - [README](./backend/README.md)
  - The frontend which is responsible for the UI and the user interaction - [README](./frontend/README.md)
  - The Database which stores the interview types and the conversation history - [README](./backend/backend/db/README.md)

## Running locally

- The following section will show you how you can run the project locally

### Prerequisites

- Install Docker and Docker Compose (you can just install Docker Desktop for Windows or Mac)
- If you want to explore the mongo database, install MongoDB Compass

### Steps

- Create .env file in repository root with the following content:

```env
PASSWORD=ANY_PASSWORD
```

- This is to allow the frontend to be password protected

- Also create a .env file in the backend repository root with the following content:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY="<FILL-ME-IN>"
OPENAI_ORGANIZATION="<FILL-ME-IN>"
OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-3.5-turbo"

DB_NAME="interview_db"
ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY="<FILL-ME-IN>"

GOOGLE_SA_PRIVATE_KEY="<FILL-ME-IN>"
GOOGLE_SA_PRIVATE_KEY_ID="<FILL-ME-IN>"
```

- Fill in the areas which say `<FILL-ME-IN>` with the appropriate values

- Run `docker-compose up --build` in repository root
- Open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser
